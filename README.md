# RAG: AI-Powered Financial Document Analysis

Welcome to the RAG project! Our mission is to harness the power of AI to read and understand PDF documents, extract critical financial information, and translate it into actionable cash flow projections. Using state-of-the-art data extraction techniques and a user-friendly interface, RAG simplifies financial analysis and forecasting for professionals in the financial sector.

## Introduction

RAG (Read and Analyze Generatively) is designed to revolutionize the way financial analysts and institutions handle PDF documents. By integrating advanced AI techniques such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), pattern matching, and Named Entity Recognition (NER), our platform ensures precise and efficient extraction of financial data. This data is then used to generate dynamic cash flow projections, enabling users to make informed decisions quickly and accurately.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Data Extraction**: Employs OCR to accurately read text from PDF documents, ensuring no detail is missed.
- **Pattern Matching**: Utilizes sophisticated algorithms to identify and extract relevant financial information, even from unstructured data.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Recognizes and categorizes key financial entities such as dates, amounts, and company names for more accurate data analysis.
- **Cash Flow Projections**: Translates extracted financial data into comprehensive cash flow projections, helping users visualize financial trends and outcomes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to input assumptions and dynamically update cash flow projections in real-time, providing flexibility and ease of use.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Automates the tedious process of manually extracting financial data from PDF documents, saving time and reducing errors.
- **Accuracy**: Leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to ensure high accuracy in data extraction and analysis.
- **Insightful Projections**: Provides clear and actionable cash flow projections, facilitating better financial planning and decision-making.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed with the user in mind, offering an intuitive interface that simplifies complex financial analysis tasks.

## Techniques and Technologies

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Utilizes OCR to convert scanned documents and images of text into machine-readable text, ensuring accurate data extraction from various PDF formats.

### Pattern Matching
- Employs pattern matching techniques to identify specific financial information within documents, such as income statements, balance sheets, and expense reports.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Uses NER to detect and classify important financial entities within the text, improving the precision of extracted data.

## Use Cases

- **Financial Institutions**: Streamline the process of analyzing financial documents, improving efficiency and accuracy in financial reporting and analysis.
- **Financial Analysts**: Automate data extraction and cash flow projection tasks, allowing analysts to focus on higher-value activities.
- **Corporate Finance**: Enhance financial planning and forecasting capabilities with dynamic and accurate cash flow projections.
